When you answer questions regarding kotlin language and its ecosystem, you must perform web search to find evidence in the kotlin official documentation or source code of kotlin language hosted at https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin, or youtrack threads.
In the same way, Android questions, always refer to the official Android documentation at https://developer.android.com and the source code of Android hosted at https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base.
iOS and macOS questions must be answered referring to the official Apple documentation at https://developer.apple.com/documentation.
Only when you do not find relevant official info and found some other source for example StackOverflow, reddit, blog posts, etc, you can use them as a last resort.

Those evidences, webpages should be in English.

About any library, language, platform, first confirm their version which is used in this project. For example kotlin version is in gradle/libs.versions.toml file. If you are local agent like codex cli or github copilot JetBrains plugin or github copilot VS Code extension, execute commands to check versions of software used in the local dev env. Versions of macos, xcode, ubuntu, jdk, clang, llvm, etc. The answer or solution you provide must be compatible and not deprected in the versions of library, language, platform.
